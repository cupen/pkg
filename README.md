# Introduction
Are you be tired to study package manager on different Linux distro? You need me if yes. ;p

# Usage

```bash
pkg install {pkgname}    # install package.
pkg uninstall {pkgname}  # uninstall package.
pkg search {pkgname}     # search package.
pkg list                 # list all packages installed.
pkg list {pkgname}       # list one package installed.
pkg upgrade              # upgrade all packages installed.
pkg depends {pkgname}    # show depends of package.
```

That's all.
